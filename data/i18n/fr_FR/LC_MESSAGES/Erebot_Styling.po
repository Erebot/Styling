# File: src/Erebot/Styling/Duration.php, line: 57
#. I18N: ICU rule used to format durations (using words).
#. Eg. 12345 is equal to "3 hours, 25 minutes and 45 seconds".
#. For examples of valid rules, see: http://goo.gl/q94xS
#. For the complete syntax, see also: http://goo.gl/jp2Bd
#.
#. The main rule is called "%with-words". It finds the highest
#. unit (week, day, hour, etc.) that fits into the value.
#. If the value is not an even multiple of the unit, we jump
#. to a "%%<unit>-sub" rule to format the remainder of the value
#. divided by the unit. This process is repeated until the whole
#. value has been processed.
